<!-- ### Pico
This website is build with a Pico Content Management System (CMS Framework). The framework translates content pages written in Markdown language to HTML code. It is a flat file CMS which means that all site content is stored in files without the need of a coupling to a database which might decrease the users ease of editing.

### Markdown
Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool that is used to add formatting elements to plain text documents. It allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid HTML.

### Twig
Twig is a PHP Template Engine. A template engine is something that combines templates with a data model to produce resulting documents. In our case Twig is used to combine HTML and PHP variables/functionality in a structured, readable and user friendly way across the website.

### SASS
The website uses SASS which is a CSS pre-processor. It helps to structure the CSS code and allows the programmer to use an increased number of functionalities such variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance etc. so changes to website lay-out is efficient and easily managed.

### Composer
Composer is dependency manager used to track, handle, install and update all the PHP library dependencies.

### Node NPM
Node NPM is very similar to Composer just for JavaScript packages.

### JSON files
Both Composer and Node NPM works with JSON files which is a text-based format used for representing structured data. The JSON files in this case stores a list of all the packages that are used, and which version.
